"Edge of Eternity" is an open-world RPG set on the continent of Elyria. The game follows Kael, a warrior with 
the power to alter time in short bursts, which he uses to evade enemies, solve puzzles, and change outcomes. 
The story centers around Elyria's descent into chaos after the Heart of Eternity—an ancient relic that maintains balance—is 
stolen by the enigmatic Shadowborn faction. Without the Heart, time fractures unpredictably across the land, 
reviving ancient beasts, causing towns to vanish and reappear, and sending people into realms of past and future.

Kael, once a member of the Order of the Silver Flame, lives in exile after a failed mission, only to discover his unique 
ability when his village is swallowed by a temporal anomaly. Guided by a being known as the Oracle, Kael sets
out to recover the Heart of Eternity and restore balance before Elyria becomes a time-ravaged wasteland.

Gameplay Mechanics "Edge of Eternity" combines RPG elements with action and puzzle-solving. 
Core gameplay focuses on exploration, combat, and Kael’s time manipulation abilities.

Time Manipulation Mechanics: Kael can briefly slow time during combat to gain the upper hand, 
allowing players to execute combos and dodge attacks. In puzzles, he can rewind structures to their original states,
revealing paths or secrets. His powers are limited by a time energy bar, requiring strategic use.

Dynamic Open World: Elyria is a vast continent with varied landscapes—from forests to snowy mountains to bustling cities. 
The world reacts to player choices, influencing faction alliances and storyline outcomes. NPCs follow routines, and quests,
creatures, and encounters shift based on the time of day.

Factions and Choices: Kael’s interactions with Elyria’s factions influence the story. 
Choices impact alliances, open or close quests, 
and determine Elyria’s future, leading to multiple endings shaped by the player’s
political and moral decisions.

Skill Trees and Customization: Kael’s abilities can be customized through skill trees, 
allowing players to specialize in combat, stealth, or time manipulation. Each tree unlocks 
unique abilities, giving flexibility to different play styles.

Art and Atmosphere Visuals blend realism with fantasy, with environments that change as
the Heart of Eternity’s influence fades. Each area takes on a distinct tone, with muted 
colors and darkening skies when the Heart is near destruction. An orchestral soundtrack
complements exploration with ambient melodies and escalates in battles, while echoes of
past events add a historical dimension to Elyria's world.
